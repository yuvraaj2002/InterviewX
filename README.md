<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GreenGuard is an innovative image classification project designed to revolutionize agriculture by providing farmers with an automated solution for the early detection of plant diseases. With the aim of mitigating crop losses and optimizing agricultural practices, GreenGuard leverages a convolutional neural network to identify and classify diseased plants into three different categories: healthy, prone to disease, and diseased.



## Built With
To build this project, I've started by outlining the programming languages that form its foundation, followed by an in-depth exploration of the libraries incorporated. This deliberate documentation not only promotes transparency but also serves as a comprehensive reference to the technologies leveraged throughout the development journey. 

- Programming Language : Python
- Libraries: Tensorflow, keras, PIL, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This section provides guidance on configuring this project on your local machine and running the Streamlit application locally.
### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure that your PC/Laptop has the following prerequisites:
- Python
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

### Project Setup

To initialize this project on your local machine, kindly adhere to the outlined instructions provided herewith. By following these meticulously crafted steps, you will seamlessly configure the project environment for optimal functionality on your personal workstation. Your cooperation in adhering to these guidelines is greatly appreciated.

1. Create a new virtual environment by using the command
   ```sh
   conda create -p venv python=3.10 -y
   ```
2. Activate the newly created virtual environment
   ```sh
   conda activate venv/
   ```
3. Install all the required project dependencies by executing the provided command. Subsequent to running this command, the internal setup file will be invoked, facilitating the configuration of your project by identifying and installing the necessary packages.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. After successfully installing all essential dependencies, proceed to run Streamlit locally by executing the following command:
   ```sh
   streamlit run Strealmit/Home.py
   ```
