we will examine how to handle missing values by simply removing them from our dataset . but before doing so, it is important to understand why we are even attempting to deal with the missing values . we can utilise CCA if there are fewer than 5% of missing values in a column . imputation is a unique technique used to replace missing values with a pre-defined arbitrary value such as -999, -1, or any other value that can be easily identified as imputed . this technique can introduce bias in the dataset, as it alters the original distribution and relationships within the data . if the missing value are categorical, the ratio of each category before and after the removal of missing values must be the same . if you liked this blog or have any suggestion kindly like this blog . support Yuvraj Singh by becoming a sponsor .
